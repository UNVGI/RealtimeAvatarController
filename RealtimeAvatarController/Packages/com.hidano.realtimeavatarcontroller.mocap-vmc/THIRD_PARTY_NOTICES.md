# Third-Party Notices

This file records third-party notices for
`com.hidano.realtimeavatarcontroller.mocap-vmc`.

## uOSC (`com.hidano.uosc`)

This package depends on `com.hidano.uosc` for OSC receive support. The package
metadata identifies uOSC as MIT licensed. At the time this notice was created,
`RealtimeAvatarController/Library/PackageCache/com.hidano.uosc@f7a52f0c524d/`
did not contain a standalone `LICENSE` file, so the uOSC MIT notice is
preserved from the archived EVMC4U third-party notice below.

## VMC Protocol Specification

The VMC receiver in this package is implemented to comply with the VMC protocol
specification for the supported receive messages:

- `/VMC/Ext/Bone/Pos`
- `/VMC/Ext/Root/Pos`

Specification: https://protocol.vmc.info/specification

VMC v2.1 extension messages such as blend shape, camera, light, and tracker
status messages are outside the scope of this package version.

## EVMC4U Inspiration Credit

EVMC4U (`gpsnmeajp/EasyVirtualMotionCaptureForUnity`) is MIT licensed. This
package no longer depends on EVMC4U at runtime, but its shared receiver model,
reference-counted lifecycle, and `SubsystemRegistration` reset pattern were
used as design inspiration for the native VMC receiver.
